## Chapter 1 - Describe the business situation of 'R&D3' with "5W1H"
**1. What is your business model? Describe industry, product, client, company size etc.**

B-Pharma is a global company that manufactures and distributes pharmaceutical products across the globe. It is based out of USA. It has research centers setup across US where extensive research is carried out to develop medicines for two medical conditions - Diabetes and Oncology. Medicines are distributed to retail sellers through a well defined distribution channel. B-Pharma aims towards helping general public, especially those who suffer from these serious medical conditions. The retail price for these medicines are lower as compared to other brands of medicines that serve the same purpose. B-Pharma has achieved this with the help of a very optimized research process and well structured distribution network.
To make Doctors and Physicians aware about these products, B-Pharma has deployed an extensive network of Sales Force in the field. This force comprises of Sales Representatives (also referred to as SalesRep) who go through an elaborated training program to promote product of both branches that B-Pharma deals with.

They visit Doctors and discuss with them the pros of these products based on Doctor's specialty. For example, a SalesRep trained to promote Oncology products will only visit Doctors those remedy patients with tumor conditions.  
	
Currently B-Pharma has 4 different products in market that cover above mentioned 2 branches of medicines -
For Diabetes there are 2 medicines that are in pipeline : D_Med_1, D_Med_2
For Oncology B-Pharma has 2 medicines that have proved to be very effective according to initial tests : O_Med_1, O_Med_2
	
B-Pharma currently comprises of 9 members. For 5 states in US (2 on east coast and 3 on west coast), there is 1 Sales Representative each. A group of states is monitored by a District Manager (DM). SalesReps who are assigned to these states (also called territories) report to their corresponding DM. There are 2 District Managers so far  (1 for east coast territories and 1 for west coast territories) in B-Pharma. Area Manager is in-charge of all territories in US. Both DMs report to Area Manager.

## Chapter 3 - Descriptions of each "Merit"

### [Merit 1] Reduced Status Update Time – Time taken by subordinates to update superiors about status of a sales call gets reduced by using SalesFast 

#### [Function 1] Sales Representative can enter outcome of a call with a doctor which will involve parameters like 'Status', 'Product Discussed', 'Date Visited', 'Duration of Meeting'. This information will get updated across the entire system as soon as the SalesRep submits from his account. District Manager and Area Manager can then see this entry when they log in. 

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA


#### [Function 2] When ever a SalesRep distributes some samples to Doctor and logs the number of samples given, it gets updated for his territory. When District Manager or Area Manager logs in, he/she will be able to see the remaining number of samples for that SalesRep.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 3] When SalesRep logs in a particular call, 1 entity is deducted from his account. Remaining number of calls for that SalesRep is updated in the system. His District and Area manager will be able to see the remaining number of calls for that SalesRep for that week. 

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

### [Merit 2] Improved Communication Channel – Communication across different levels in hierarchy  regarding any change in alignment or assignment of a SalesRep will take less time and effort with SalesFast. This will help in alleviating problematic long email chains.   

#### [Function 1] Users at different levels will log in to the same platform with their own unique user id and password. Being on the same platform will ensure  quick correspondence.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 2] Area Manager can re assign a SalesRep from one District Manager to another. This change in mapping gets percolated down to District Manager's and Sales Rep's account automatically without any need for explicit communication from Area Manager.

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA

### [Merit 3] Better Control Over Sales Process – Area Manager and District Manager can track the progress of Sales Calls with various parameters on a real time basis. This will allow them to proactively take any actions to improve the Sales output or call the team for a meeting to discuss any modulation required in the existing sales process.

#### [Function 1] Area Manager and District manager will be able to see the status of calls being executed by Sales Rep under them. How many calls have been executed this week, how many  are in progress, how many got converted to 'submitted'. 

**Priority:** Low

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 2] District managers will be able to see the number of calls made and remaining by a SalesRep for the week. They can even change (increase or decrease) the remaining number anytime in between the week.

**Priority:** Medium
