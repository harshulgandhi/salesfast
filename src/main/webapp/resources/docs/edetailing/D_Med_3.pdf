Brentuximab Vedotin
Mechanism of Action

                                                        1. ADC binds to CD30

2. ADC-CD30 complex is  CD30
internalized and
trafficks to lysosome

3. MMAE is
released

                                                                              6. Apoptosis (cell death)

4. MMAE binds           5. G2/M cell
tubulin and             cycle arrest
prevents microtubule
assembly

Key Concepts for Patients With Relapsed
or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma

Background                                            Hodgkin
• Malignant cells express CD30                       lymphoma
Disease impact
• Not cured with current standard treatments          ~ 100 %
• Median OS
                                                        ~ 25%
  – After failure of autologous transplant
  – Post-ASCT failure in < 1 year                       29 mo
• Typical response to available treatment = partial     14 mo
• Typical duration of response                       20% - 60%
                                                      3 - 12 mo

      Brentuximab vedotin was given intravenously every 3 weeks in
         escalating doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.6 mg/kg in successive cohorts

      1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks
           – Defined as MTD; also reasonably well-tolerated over months of

           – Obtained durable complete remissions
           – Employed in the subsequent, paired registrational trials

Statistical Considerations

Hodgkin Lymphoma

Trial and analyses conducted under Special
  Protocol Assessment

Primary statistical hypothesis: ORR 95% CI
  lower bound > 20%

   – Study size of 100 patients was chosen to
      allow evaluation of primary hypothesis

   – Observation of an ORR of 29% or greater
      would exclude a lower bound of 20%

ORR = Overall response rate.

Management of Peripheral Neuropathy

 Patients should be monitored for signs and
   symptoms of PN

 Neuropathy events
    – Primarily sensory
    – Appear to be associated with cumulative dosing
    – Largely reversible

 Patients experiencing new or worsening Grade 2 PN
    – Hold dosing until resolution to Grade 1
       or baseline
    AND
    – Reduce dose to 1.2 mg/kg

In the event of IRR or anaphylaxis

   – Stop infusion
   – Institute appropriate medical management
   – Restart infusion (at a slower rate)
   – Premedication with subsequent infusions
