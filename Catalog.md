## Chapter 1 - Describe the business situation of 'R&D3' with "5W1H"
**1. What is your business model? Describe industry, product, client, company size etc.**

### INDUSTRY:

**BioPharma** is a global company that manufactures and distributes pharmaceutical products across the globe. It is based out of USA. It has research centers setup across US where extensive research is carried out to develop medicines for two medical conditions - Diabetes and Oncology. Medicines are distributed to retail sellers through a well defined distribution channel. BioPharma aims towards helping general public, especially those who suffer from these serious medical conditions. The retail price for these medicines are lower as compared to other brands of medicines that serve the same purpose. BioPharma has achieved this with the help of a very optimized research process and well structured distribution network.

To make Physicians aware about these products, BioPharma has deployed an extensive network of Sales Force in the field. This force comprises of Sales Representatives (also referred to as SalesRep) who go through an elaborated class room training program to promote product of both branches that BioPharma deals with.

They visit physicians and discuss with them the pros of these products based on Doctor's specialty. For example, a SalesRep trained to promote Oncology products will only visit physicians those remedy patients with tumor conditions. The sole purpose of these meetings is to influence the physician towards prescribing medicines manufactured by BioPharma that will eventually increase the sales and overall profit. 

### PRODUCT:  

Currently BioPharma has 4 different products in market that cover above mentioned 2 branches of medicines:
- For Diabetes there are 2 medicines : D_Med_1, D_Med_2
- For Oncology BioPharma has 2 medicines that have proved to be very effective according to initial tests : O_Med_1, O_Med_2

### COMPANY SIZE:

BioPharma currently comprises of 8 members. For 5 states in US (2 on east coast and 3 on west coast), there is 1 Sales Representative each. A group of states is monitored by a District Manager (DM). SalesReps who are assigned to these states (also called territories) report to their corresponding DM. There are 2 District Managers so far  (1 for east coast territories and 1 for west coast territories) in BioPharma. National Head is in-charge of all territories in US. Both DMs report to National Head. 
    

**2. Who do you think would be involved in your business? List up role, person, or group as many as possible.**

To better the sales of any pharmaceutical company, it is important that a SalesRep's time is utilized with minimal wastage. This way he/she can visit more physicians and hence higher chances of large number of physicians getting influenced. This can be achieved by a balanced blend of innovative technology and appropriate and shrewd involvement of higher management people in the organisation. 
  
- The first role that will be involved in this process is Sales Representative itself. Their primary role is to meet physicians and discuss about medicines that BioPharma has come up with. They try to influence these physicians to prescribe these to their patients. SalesRep can use SalesFast on a daily basis that would save a significant portion of their time and also help in reducing cost of existing sales process in BioPharma.
- Another role involved is that of District Manager. He is responsible for monitoring sales of a particular district and take relevant actions to improve it.
- Highest role at BioPharma is of National Head. He/she is responsible for sales of all the states covered in US. 

**3. Describe each of their work flow: WHAT are they responsible for? WHEN, WHERE and WHAT do they work?**

## Chapter 3 - Descriptions of each "Merit"

### [Merit 1] Cost cutting and saving time of Sales Representatives:
One of biggest concerns for BioPharma and many other pharmaceutical organisation is that a considerable portion of SalesRep's time is consumed in  repeatedly travelling long distance. They also have to spend a lot of time to attend multiple class room training program to get well versed with the company's sales policies and medical products. This precious time can be saved by using SalesFast and can be put to better use, for example, **attending more sales meetings and generating more profit**.This will also help in **cutting the cost incurred on training** of SalesRep by reducing the number of class room training sessions.

#### [Function 1] Virtual Coaching Support: 
The material used during first class room training for SalesRep will be available on SalesFast for SalesRep's quick reference. They can peruse it multiple times to make themselves well acquainted with the product and policies of the company.

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 2] :
District Manager and National Heads will be able to update the training material on SalesFast so that SalesRep can refer to the updated material.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 3] e-Detailing: 
If a physician agrees to prescribe a particular medicine, he/she will be given a user id & password to login to a portal on SalesFast, provided the physician is willing to use it. This portal will contain details about the product SalesRep presented in the last meeting and also upcoming products will be introduced on the same portal. This way, SalesRep doesn't have to visit the physician very frequently, saving his time, and also the physician comes in direct contact with the organisation through the portal. 

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 4]
National Head will be able to add a product to e-detailing portal, in case a new product is launched. This will provide a unified platform for physicians to know about the product quickly. Details will include medicine's usability, its side effects, conditions under which it should not be used, what age group should be prescribed which strength of the medicine.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 5]
To add more intelligence to the system, e-detailing portal will track the duration of time spent by a physician on each page. This data will be compiled by SalesFast and National Head and DMs will have access to it. They can sort it based on time duration and understand which section of e-detailing is most famous among physicians. This key insight  will help them alter their policies, research plans and call plans to cater more profits.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

### [Merit 2] Power to create intelligent cycle plans to drive better profit:
District Manager and National Heads create cycle plans for Sales Representatives where each cycle could be of 2 or 3 weeks. SalesRep execute calls based on this plan. Needless to say, company's profit depends on this plan significantly. It is inevitable to design it in such a fashion that its execution generates more profit in less time. SalesFast can help notably in this direction. SalesRep and Physicians, from their respective portals, can select the possible reasons for the outcome of the meeting. For example, if physician agrees to prescribe the medicine, what are the reasons that influenced him, such as - he genuinely liked the product or price is less as compared to other similar medicines in market, less side effects, liked the presentation, impressed by company's reputation. Similar options will be given to SalesRep. 
SalesRep and Physicians will keep on making such submissions through out the cycle. At the end of every cycle, SalesFast will automatically analyse the data received so far and generate output that would help National Head and District Managers in making **informed decisions** to modulate the cycle plan if needed. The output will contain details like - For all the physicians whose status changed from "Prospecting" to "Lost", what was the primary reason for this negative change. Similarly for other combinations of status changes. This is a vital piece of information that would significantly help to increase the conversion rate of sales calls and eventually lead to better profit.

#### [Function 1] 
When a physician agrees to prescribe a certain product, he/she is given a set user id and password to login to the SalesFast. Upon first login, he/she will have to select one or more than one reasons as to what influenced him/her to agree to prescribe the product. It will be a pre-populated list of plausible reasons. This submission will be accessible by National Head and District managers. They can run some analysis on this to understand various aspects of successful sales calls from physician's perspective, for example, what factor about the sales call influences the physicians most, what are their expectations from the pharmaceutical industry, which area is a good target area. Then they can update the cycle plan based on this understanding. 

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA
 
#### [Function 2] 
After a sales call, SalesRep, from his own portal, can select reasons for the outcome and other attributes of the meeting from a pre-populated list. These may include type of product well received, which area demands which type of medicines, whether physician was interested in future correspondence (in person or through other means).  

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 3] 
All the information submitted in Function 1 & 2 will be analysed by SalesFast at the end of every cycle. It will automatically generate a report for National Head's and DM's perusal that could contain details about primary reasons for physicians being "Lost" or becoming "Prescribing". This can serve as a very **good building block** for a robust and profitable cycle plan.  

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA


### [Merit 3] Less time consuming and smoother correspondence among SalesRep and Managers:
In absence of an integrated tool, sales activities require constant flow of update emails between SalesRep and managers. SalesReps and managers spend a lot of time on such activities. For example:

- SalesRep need to update managers about outcome of a meeting
- Manager having to communicate to the Rep any change in his/her alignment with a particular physician
- Any update in the training material or sales policies need to be communicated to SalesRep explicitly

SalesFast provides an **integrated platform** to perform these updates and the respective communication is taken care of by the software application itself. 

#### [Function 1]:
After a sales call, SalesRep, from his own portal, can submit update about the call based on a fixed set of parameters, for example which physician was visited and which medicine was discussed, what is the status of this physician - _Specified_,_Prospecting_,_Lost_. This submission will be visible to the respective District Manager.

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 2]:
District Manager and National Heads can change the alignment of a SalesRep from one physician to another. This **information immediately gets percolated down** to other users who are using the system, including SalesReps. Thus there is no need to explicitly inform SalesRep about this change.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA
 
#### [Function 3]:
SalesRep have a fixed set of material using which they are trained. This material will be available on SalesFast and can be updated by National Head or District Manager. These updates need not be explicitly communicated to the SalesRep as they will have 'read-only' access to the same (updated) material.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

### [Merit 4] Integrated platform for mutual learning:
The area of Sales force management and sales processes of many industries have become so mature that now most of the learning can be derived only from real life experiences of Sales Representatives while carrying out daily sales activities and related anecdotes. Many organizations and industries are adopting different ways to allow SalesReps to share such experiences and it has shown significant improvement in overall functioning of organizations. 
SalesFast provides a unified platform for all SalesReps of BioPharma to share anecdotes from their experience of representing their company in the field. Some of these stories provide a good learning curve because some SalesReps are not able to handle certain situations on the field that have already been experienced by some other representatives. This builds a **robust peer to peer learning model** among colleagues. 

#### [Function 1]:
Once every month, National Head will open the platform to share anecdotes. All sales representatives will receive a notification saying they can submit their anecdotes from their respective accounts.

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 2]:
Before filling out anecdotes, each SalesRep will have to select the type of anecdote from a pre-populated list of possible scenarios. After all the submissions, National Head can analyze the submissions under some of the important categories and try to figure out if there is any pattern in problems faced by SalesReps during daily sales activities. 

**Priority:** High

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 3]:
All the submissions, grouped as per categories, will be visible to all representatives. They can read it anytime they want and gain insights about experiences of other SalesReps and learn.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

### [Merit 5] Hassle free incentive calculation:
Incentive calculation is an important sales activity and should be done with precision. To decouple it from the factor of human error, SalesFast provides a hassle free, automatic incentive calculator that, with minimum manual intervention, calculates incentives for District Managers and Sales Representatives. 
Incentive calculated is directly proportional to the amount of work done by SalesRep or DM, which quantified by the percentage of different targets achieved by them. One simple example is, percentage of physicians changing from "Prospecting" to "Prescribing" in a territory of SalesRep. 

#### [Function 1]:
At the end of each quarter, Incentive Calculator fetches the latest data from his account which describes percentage target achieved by that SalesRep. It also fetches the maximum incentive assigned for SalesRep and calculates the actual value of incentive based on these information. Before disbursing the incentive to SalesRep, National Head can cross check the values.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 2]:
In case of District Managers, apart from fetching the percentage target achieved (in terms of calls), Incentive Calculator also checks the percentage change in Over The Counter sales of all the medicines in that district. It then calculates the incentive based on these parameters. 

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

### [Merit 6] Sample Distribution Management and firsthand patient feedback system:
Primary purpose of sample medicines is to  verify the effectiveness of the medicine. SalesRep issue a fixed number of sample medicines to physicians. They then give it to visiting patients. 
Two important things that need to be taken care of are - District Manager and National Head should know how many samples were distributed to which physician. Secondly, BioPharma needs feedback from patients to know if the medicine actually worked or no. SalesFast helps in solving these.

#### [Function 1]:
At the beginning of each quarter, District Manager assigns a fixed number of sample medicines to all SalesReps. If a physician's status changes to "Prescribing" or "Prospecting", SalesRep can offer samples medicines to him/her and enter the number of samples given on SalesFast under his account. These updates will also be visible to District Manager and National Head.

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA

#### [Function 2]:
Each stripe/box of sample medicine will have a QR code pointing to an open page on SalesFast. Patients using that medicine can go to the page and provide their feedback in the form of answers to some very simple questions. These submissions will be visible to District Manager and National Head. 

**Priority:** Medium

**Implemented:** NA
